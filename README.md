# PairingVibration
Code for the calculation of Pairing Vibration with phenomenological Random Phase Approximation (RPA)

Andrea Idini


##How to Run:
Use Makefile to compile.
Change nucleus and proton/neutron vibration in Input\_WS.in, the program will scan the
Atomic Mass Evaluation 2012 for masses and enjoy the rest.


##Output:
Factor.dat and RPA.dat, for X and Y RPA amplitudes and energy of the phonons (in two formats).
Dispersion.dat, dispersion relation of RPA.


##Physics:
If you don't have much idea what a Pairing Vibration and what a Random Phase Approximation (RPA) is, have a torough look at:
